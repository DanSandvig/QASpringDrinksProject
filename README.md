# QASpringDrinksProject

## Why Are We Doing This?

This project will assess our ability to build a basic backend java service using Spring Boot to program an API with CRUD functionality.  
The program will perform operations on a MySql database in response to http requests to demonstrate our understanding of, and ability to direct, the flow of data in a manner similar to production software.  
We will also be demonstrating our wider understanding of software design through detailed project management, effective source control, thorough testing, and appropriate documentation.

## How I Expected The Challenge To Go

Thanks to what we had been taught during the course I was reasonably confident of getting the functionality of the program working - my main concerns in terms of time and complexity were the project management and testing aspects.

## What Went Well/What Didn't Go As Planned?

As I expected setting up Jira and writing the Unit and Integration tests took up the majority of time spent on the project.  
I had assumed that as MoSCoW and Acceptance Criteria seemed to standard practice they would be a default part of Jira so I hadn't counted on having to learn how to set them up myself, but once I understood a bit more on how to customize Jira it was relatively straightforward.  
Writing the unit tests took me a bit of time to get into the right mindset, there were a couple of methods I initially struggled to work out how to test, but in the end I got them all done and achieved over 95% coverage in the end so I was please with that.
I was pleased and relieved when all by CRUD tests with postman worked first time, for all I had completed all the unit and integration tests I'm still not experienced enough to "trust the process" and was convinced something would still go wrong the first time I ran the app.
