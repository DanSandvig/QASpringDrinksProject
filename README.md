# QASpringDrinksProject

## Why Are We Doing This?

This project will assess our ability to build a basic backend java service using Spring Boot to program an API with CRUD functionality.  
The program will perform operations on a MySql database in response to http requests to demonstrate our understanding of, and ability to direct, the flow of data in a manner similar to production software.  
We will also be demonstrating our wider understanding of software design through effective source control, thorough testing, and appropriate documentation.
